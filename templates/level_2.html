<div class="text-wrapper" id="text-wrap">
    
      
        I, the terror that lurks in the night,|
        Have sown the seeds of a fateful plight.|
        A bomb planted deep within the city's dreams,|
        Its ticking clock, the harbinger of its screams.|
        |
        To you, my dear agents, I bring this game,
        A challenge that will surely test your aim.
        The prize, the city's safety, the cost, its soul,
        A battle between you and me, to take its toll.
        |
        The rules are simple, find and diffuse,
        The ticking time bomb, before it's use.
        I'll be your guide, your opponent too,
        In this game of life, where only one will come through.
        
        The button waits, to start the show,
        The curtains rise, the clock starts to glow.
        Tick! Tock! Tick! Tock! Time is running low,
        The city awaits, its fate to be known.
        
        So, go ahead, make your move,
        Save the city, earn its love.
        But beware, I am not what I seem,
        For I am a monster, a psychopathic dream.
